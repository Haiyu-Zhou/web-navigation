1. The different purpose of content.js and popup.js
Content scripts  primarily interact with the web pages, while popup scripts handle the behavior and interactions within the extension's popup UI.
2. the history has to be searched in background.js
3. the maximum size of popup is 600 x 600 px

problems:
1. link not working // wrap <div> inside <a>
2. how to read domain names in the url? in order to catagorize them --- clicked times to size
